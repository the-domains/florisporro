# I'm a professional geek.

After completing an education in Audiovisual Production, I've had the pleasure of working on a large variety of projects. Anything from complex multiscreen projection setups to flying drones and creating custom video production tools. I'm at a distinct advantage of understanding both creativity and technology. I don't claim to be good at everything, but can easily tell the good from the bad.
